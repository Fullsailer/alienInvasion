In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. They player can move the ship left or right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.

When the game begins, a fleet of alien ships fill the sky and move across and down the screen. The player shoots and  destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses the ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
